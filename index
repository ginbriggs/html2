            I love <b>sleeping</b> because I always feel well rested no matter how many hours or minutes I spend sleeping. <br> If I'm in a negative or poor mood, sleeping always pushes those negative emotions away and replaces them with positive ones! <aside>I strongly believe sleep is a gift.</aside>

        <p>
            I enjoy <b>drawing</b> because it allows me to freely connect with my <i>emotions</i> due to the fact I'm poor at verbally communicating them. <br> It allows me to vent out any emotions I have, positive or negative, in order to create something that doesn't already exist!

        <header><h3>Lastly, I love <em>watching</em> cartoons on my free time. The older cartoons of cartoon network to be specific.</h3></header>

        <p>
            A lot of my childhood was spent watching older <b>cartoons</b> such as Courage the Cowardly Dog, Teen Titans, and all the good classics.<br> It's also where I got a lot of my drawing inspiration from.
